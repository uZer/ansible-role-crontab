* This role configures crontab an removes crons/vars when they are not in ansible

* All variables should be configured in `host_vars` or `group_vars`.

* The file `/etc/cron.d/ansible_cron` is used by default for crontabs and vars.

* Please note that deletion is only managed when `file: ...` is not specified.
If you plan to put your crontabs in various files, this role doesn't have much
utility for you since deletion tasks won't parse your file. You should fallback
to a _classic_ galaxy role in that case.
